# sentiment-analyzer
This is a python script to perform sentiment analysis on tweets of a keyword given by the user. 
We will use the Tweepy library to retrieve tweets based on the given keyword and the Textblob library to perform sentiment analysis.
We will also use the Pandas library to store the final result in a dataframe and write it to a CSV file.
